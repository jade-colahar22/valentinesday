            <p>Dear Ivancito,<br><br>

                Happy Valentine’s Day, I know I could’ve written a lame handwritten message but what’s the fun in that yk?
                
                Anyway. I just want to emphasize how incredibly grateful I am to have you, there’s nothing more I could ever want or ask for. From the very short time period that we’ve known each other you’ve taught me what it’s like to love and trust again. You’ve showed me that it’s not a weakness to love or trust as long as you’re expelling that to the right person, gladly I have you. As you know I’ve always had issues with those things, then came those other things that made my trust falter, I never thought I’d be able to recover from the past but you effortlessly showed me that it’s okay to be vulnerable with you.
                
                You make my heart feel full every day, and I cherish every moment we share. I love the way you listen, and the way you care. I want you to know that my love for you runs deeper than words can express. I dream of a future where we continue to grow together, face life's challenges hand in hand, and build countless memories that will last a lifetime.
                
                Thank you for being you—kind, patient, and loving. Even when I'm not the best at most times, and for that I am eternally grateful. 
                I hope our journey together never ends because I can’t imagine my life without you in it anymore. Again, Happy Valentines day and I am excited to share this weekend with you. 
                
                
                <br> <br> Forever yours,
                <br> <br> <br>
                Jade C
